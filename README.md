Here are some PHPUnit test examples I have made

1. Install PHPUnit and PHPStorm to yÃ¶u computer
2. Create tests-folder to your project
3. Program you testcode
4. You can run it from your CLI : ./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests
5. You cen also run your code from PHPStorm:
   Settings -> PHP -> Test Frameworks

6. Select testfile from the right bar of PHPStorm -> RUN your code
